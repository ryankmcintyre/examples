== Health Probe

For this example we need a Kubernetes installation as described in link:../../INSTALL.adoc[INSTALLATION.adoc].

Here we are reusing our https://github.com/k8spatterns/random-generator[random-generator] which also includes support for health checks.

To apply a Deployment with liveness and readiness check enabled, use

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f https://k8spatterns.io/HealthProbe/deployment.yml
----

This deployment introduces an artificial pause of 20 seconds before the application becomes ready.
To monitor the readiness and liveness states you best open an extra terminal with running

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods -w
NAME                                READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
random-generator-5856b5f774-54h6b   0/1     Running       0          5s
random-generator-5856b5f774-54h6b   1/1     Running       0          38s
----

The example apps expose two endpoints with which you can switch the state of the readiness and liveness checks.
For simplicity reasons, we haven't installed a Service or Ingress for this sample (if you do, or already have one set up from a previous example, replace *localhost* with the Public IP of your Service and skip the port-forward step.)

Instead we are using a simple port-forwarding directly to the pod to trigger the toggles:

[source, bash]
----
# Port forward to Pod. "pod" is an alias to pick the full name of the pod (see INSTALL.adoc)
kubectl port-forward $(pod random-generator) 8080:8080 &
----

Now you can switch on/off the readiness/liveness checks and see how the cluster manages your pods:

[source, bash]
----
# Check liveness probe by querying the actuator
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq .

# Toggle liveness check to off
curl -s http://localhost:8080/toggle-live

# Check liveness probe again
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq .

# Watch the pods and wait a bit. What happens after 2-3 mins ?
kubectl get pods -w

# Now switch readiness off
curl -s http://localhost:8080/toggle-ready

# Watch the pods for 1-2 mins
kubectl get pods -w

# Toggle readiness back on
curl -s http://localhost:8080/toggle-ready

# Watch the pods again ...
kubectl get pods -w
----
